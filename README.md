* Onside Code Execution: Execute TypeScript and JavaScript code directly within the application using web workers, ensuring optimal performance without affecting the main application thread.
* Test Cases: Add and execute test cases for both JavaScript and TypeScript to compare their outputs and behavior effectively.
* Output Display: View the result of your code execution in real time for immediate feedback.
* Performance Graphs: Compare code execution performance with visualized data, including runtime and operations per second metrics.
* Resizable Panels: Adjust the panel sizes to suit your preferences and enhance user experience.
* Responsive Design: Optimized layout for all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
* Dark and Light Modes: Seamlessly switch between dark and light themes based on your preferences.
